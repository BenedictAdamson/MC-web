The mc Helm chart packages the server components of an installation of MC. The chart provides two Kubernetes *deployments* (pods):
* one for the (MongoDB) database, {{ .Release.Name }}-db-deploy
* one for the front-end and back-end HTTPD servers, {{ .Release.Name }}-http-deploy.

The chart includes a Kubernetes *ingress*, which directs all (HTTPD) traffic to the HTTPD servers.

Separately to installing the mc Helm chart you must set up a Kubernetes *ingress controller*, which implements the *ingress* provided in the chart.
For minikube, you can do that using the command

minikube addons enable ingress
