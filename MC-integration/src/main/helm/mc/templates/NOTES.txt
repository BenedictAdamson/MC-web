The mc Helm chart packages the server components of an installation of MC. The chart provides two Kubernetes *deployments* (pods):
* one for the (MongoDB) database, {{ .Release.Name }}-db-deploy
* one for the front-end and back-end HTTPD servers, {{ .Release.Name }}-http-deploy.

The chart includes a Kubernetes *ingress*, which directs all (HTTPD) traffic to the HTTPD servers.

Separately to installing the mc Helm chart you must set up a Kubernetes *ingress controller*, which implements the *ingress* provided in the chart.
For minikube, you can do that using the command

minikube addons enable ingress

And after installation of the chart, get the IP address through which to access MC through the minikube ingress controller using the command

kubectl get ingress
