## Components

MC provides a web interface: you play it using a web browser, using a URL that indicates the installation (server) of MC that you wish to play. An installation of MC has several components that together provide the information used by your browser:
* A *front-end*, which runs in the browser.
* A *front-end HTTP server*, which provides your browser with the code for the front-end.
* A *back end HTTP server*, which does the complicated processing.
* A *database server*, which records long term information for the back end HTTP server.
* Optionally, an *HTTP reverse proxy* (also call the *ingress*), which communicates with the browser. It forwards requests from the browser (or front-end) to the *front-end HTTP server* and to the *back end HTTP server*, as appropriate for each request.

The back end HTTP server makes use of code in the *model* component.
The servers are processes, and so could run on one computer, or several.

The system has separate front-end and back-end HTTP servers because of the technical difficulty of combining them.
The front-end HTTP serving must provide identical static front-end code at multiple URLs,
because of the [Angular](https://angular.io/) *routing* of the front-end.
The back-end HTTP serving, by [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
is more suitable for fixed routing of resources, with each resource having only one URL.

The build system makes the software available as a collection of Debian installation packages
(also suitable for Ubuntu, and other Debian derivatives),
and as a Helm chart and Docker images.
When using the Debian packages, the *database server* component must be installed on a computer
that has a MongoDB server installed,
which can be done by following the
[MongoDB installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/).
