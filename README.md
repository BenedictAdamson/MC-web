## Components

MC provides a web interface: you play it using a web browser, using a URL that indicates the installation (server) of MC that you wish to play. An installation of MC has several components that together provide the information used by your browser:
* A *front-end*, which runs in the browser.
* An *HTTP reverse proxy* (also call the *ingress*), which communicates with the browser. It forwards requests from the browser (or front-end) to the *front-end HTTP server* and to the *back end HTTP server*, as appropriate for each request.
* A *front-end HTTP server*, which provides your browser with the code for the front-end.
* A *back end HTTP server*, which does the complicated processing.
* A *game database server*, which records long term information for the back end HTTP server.
* An *authentication server*, which handles logins.
* An *authentication database server*, which records long term information authentication server.

The back end HTTP server makes use of code in the *model* component.
An *authentication initialisation job* sets up basic authentication information.

The system has separate front-end and back-end HTTP servers because of the technical difficulty of combining them.
The front-end HTTP serving must provide identical static front-end code at multiple URLs,
because of the [Angular](https://angular.io/) *routing* of the front-end.
The back-end HTTP serving, by [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
is more suitable for fixed routing of static resources, with each resource having only one URL.

The system has separate game and authentication database servers because the (third party) authentication server does support the kind of database server that is suitable for the game itself.
