## Overview

This component does the complicated processing for an installation of MC.
It communicates with a *database server*, which records long term information.
It makes use of code in the *model* component.

This component is a [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application,
built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
and the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.3.RELEASE/maven-plugin/).
That results in an executable JAR.
The component is also built as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image,
which is published on Docker Hub at
[https://hub.docker.com/r/benedictadamson/mc-back-end](https://hub.docker.com/r/benedictadamson/mc-back-end).

Because a Spring Boot executable JAR can not also be used as a library JAR,
code that might be shared with other Java components of MC
(and in particular, is used by integration test code)
is in the *model* component rather than this component.

## Configuration

The back end HTTPD server of Mission Command is a Spring Boot application,
and so can be configured by setting Spring properties
(using environment variables, Java properties, YAML properties and command-line arguments)
like other Spring Boot applications.
* It uses the MongoDB drivers, so the `spring.data.mongodb.*` properties are available.
  In particular, `spring.data.mongodb.host` and `spring.data.mongodb.password`
  should be set to enable connection to the database server.
* The `administrator.password` property is the (unencrypted) password of the special administrator user of the system.
