Feature: Home-page
  It should be easy for players to access the home-page of an MC server.

  Scenario: Potential player accesses an MC server using a simple URL with the root path
    Given the DNS name, example.com, of an MC server
    When the potential player gives the obvious URL http://example.com/ to a web browser
    And not logged in
    And not presenting a CSRF token
    Then MC serves the web page
